Introduction
============

Plone's *related items* functionality is a powerful feature but content
managers mostly fail to do it (unless they are very committed and know their
content very well). Here simserver comes to the rescue and assists in this
task.

``collective.simserver.related`` provides a form to query the simserver for
similar items and set them as related items. A simserver *collection*
queries the simserver for all documents related to this collection.
