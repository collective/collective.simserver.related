Introduction
============

The related items is a powerful feature but content managers mostly
(unless they are very committed and know their content very well)
fail to do it, here simserver comes to the rescue and assists in this
task.

collective.simserver.related provides a form to query the simserver for
similar items and set them as related items. A simserver collection
that queries the simserver for all documents related to this collection
